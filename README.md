# Expo Linking API iOS Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's `Linking` API where opening URLs on iOS fails silently without providing any error messages.  The issue is specific to iOS and works as expected on Android.

## Bug Description

When attempting to open a URL using `Linking.openURLAsync`, the function returns successfully on iOS, but the URL never opens.  No errors are thrown or logged, making debugging difficult.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the project on iOS simulator or device.
3. Tap the button to open the URL.  Observe that the URL does not open, but no error is reported.
4. Run the project on Android simulator or device. Observe that the URL opens correctly.

## Expected Behavior

The URL should open in the user's default browser regardless of platform.

## Actual Behavior

The URL opens correctly on Android, but fails silently on iOS.

## Solution

The solution involves checking the return value of `Linking.canOpenURLAsync` before attempting to open the URL, and handling the potential failure case.  This updated version provides more detailed feedback to the user.
